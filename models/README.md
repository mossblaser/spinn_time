Initial Models of Algorithm
===========================

This directory contains two simple software models of the clock synchronisation
algorithm. `pll2.py` is largely a messier, floating point implementation.
`pll3.py` is somewhat more structured and is implemented using fixed-point
arithmetic. There is no `pll1.py`...
